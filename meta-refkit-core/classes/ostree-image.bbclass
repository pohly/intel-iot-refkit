# Support for OSTree-upgradable images.
#
# This class adds support for building images with OSTree system
# update support. It is an addendum to refkit-image.bbclass (i.e.
# not tested with anything else) and is supposed to be inherited
# by it conditionally when the "ostree" distro feature is set.
#
# When enabled both in the distro and image, the class adds:
#
#     - publishing builds to an HTTP-serviceable repository
#     - boot-time selection of the most recent rootfs tree
#     - booting an OSTree enabled image into a rootfs
#     - pulling in image upgrades using OSTree
#
