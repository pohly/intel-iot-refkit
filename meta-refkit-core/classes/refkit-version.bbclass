# When building in a CI system with swupd enabled, OS_VERSION must be
# set to a consistent value for all builds. See below
# for an example how that works with Jenkins.
#
# In local builds, we only have ${DATETIME} as something that
# increments automatically, but it is too large for an integer number
# on 32 bit systems. Therefore we substract the 2016 as the initial
# year in which IoT Reference OS Kit started using swupd and ignore the
# seconds.
#
# The default behavior is to not rebuild just because OS_VERSION
# changed. If that is desired, include in local.conf:
#   VERSION_ID = "${OS_VERSION}"
# This will cause the os-release package to be rebuilt each time
# OS_VERSION changes, and that in turn causes an image and bundle
# rebuild.
#
# For more predictable results is possible to set OS_RELEASE manually,
# either in local.conf or in the environment like this:
#   BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE="$BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE OS_VERSION" OS_VERSION=110 bitbake ...

        # In the CI system, the integer OS version used for swupd is derived
